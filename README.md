* Flexbox
> Flexbox is a layout model that helps with sizing and positioning of related elements over one direction.
By making an element a flexbox container (using display: flex) you can easily adjust the position and size of its children by letting the browser do the calculations automatically for you.
It has several properties that let you specify where each child element should be place, in which order, and how much space should they take.
